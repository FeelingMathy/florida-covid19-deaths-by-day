The CSV files in this repository are daily exports of the
[`Florida_COVID_19_Deaths_by_Day`][tbl] table. The Florida Department of Health
appears to updated the table once a day around 10am-11am Eastern time.

[tbl]: https://fdoh.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=230270972343459a812a1ae8c28574a6

The [download](download) Python script automatically downloads the table, converts it from
JSON to CSV format, and saves it as `deathsbydateexport_YYYYMMDD.csv`. The columns are:

* `Date`: milliseconds since UNIX Epoch time
* `Deaths`: number of deaths on this date
* `ObjectId`: unknownâ€”not important

If for whatever reason you want to download the table without using the script:
